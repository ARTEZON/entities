<h1>The backstory</h1>
<p>
It was the year 2022, and I have made a simple shrimple test file<br>
for testing C++ pass-by-reference. Because back then, I was just starting out.
<br><br>
Time skip to <b>30th of July, 2024</b>, I have sent the entities.cpp file<br>
in a group chat with my good friends <a href="https://github.com/MF366-Coding">MF366</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MaybeHawk1">MaybeHawk</a>, <br>and then MaybeHawk decided to compile it. That's when it all began...<br><br>
On 2nd of August, while me and MaybeHawk have been messing around, I have said the following words:<br>
<img src="assets/must_make.png" alt="I must make entities2.cpp" style="height:100px"></img><br>
These words have propelled the development of <i>entities2.cpp</i>.<br>
I began brainstorming and coming up with ideas. And I feel like I cooked well.<br>
Here is a picture from development:<br><img src="assets/vscode_sidepanel_view.png" alt="VSCode sidepanel" style="width:60px"></img> Don't zoom on it, just enjoy it from afar.<br><br>
As a little tiny joke, I have added goto's and heap allocation to this game as well,<br>
because who doesn't love those, amirite?<br>
After 2 days of development, the game was officialy complete at 4th of August, about 30 minutes past midnight.<br>
The development was long and hard ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) in fact, before I finished it completely, I have coded for:<br>
<img src="entities2/entity2_in_the_making.png" alt="6 hours" style="height:100px"></img><br>
However, it was worth every second.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!!!<br>
